   <p align="justify"><b>History and Archaeology</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is History? History is an account of events that have happened in the past.It is about the real people and the real things. It does not deal with mere ideas and ideals or what should have been. On the other hand, it is a study of what has been.History does not deal with individuals alone. It is concerned with nations and societies. It is not limited to kings and queens, but all human beings. It includes all men and women, rich and poor irrespective of their background in terms of religion caste etc. Have you ever wondered how and what happened to our ancestors in ancient times? You will learn about them in this book. While going through this course, note down all the events which seem interesting to you. Go to the libraries and search the internetto see if you can get more information on them. We will also help you in your search for more knowledge.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Why do we study History?</b> The study of History helps us to know our roots, strengths and achievements and gives us a sense of pride as well as direction. What we call progress would be non-existent if we do not have proper knowledge and understanding of our past. There is a general belief that history deals with the past, which we think is dead. In reality, our past has important lessons for the present and the future. History records this legacy that has an important bearing on our lives. In essence, history relates the story of cooperative actions of a large number of men and women in their quest for a better life. When we think of how we can know about our past, we get connected to Archaeology. Often these past activities and achievements bring a sense of pride. Let us keep them safe for our future generations. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Archaeology</b> is the study of the ancient times with respect to society and culture. The traces of those events can be found in material remains i.e. the artifacts, burials, ruined buildings, monuments, etc. and are studied by archaeologists. They
interpret them to provide knowledge about the times to which these artifacts belong. The study of Archaeology also includes the written records that are very ancient and cannot be easily deciphered or understood. These sources give more reliable and authentic information.
  Most of the time, such traces are found buried underground and have to be dug out. This is called archaeological excavation. Mohenjo-dar Harappa and Nalanda are some well known sites where excavations have been undertaken and valuable material found. Such excavations are often  carried out and reported in the newspapers. A very interesting recent discovery is that of the remains of a city found under the sea near Gujarat. It is believed to be Hindu God Krishna’s city Dwarka. Rakhigarhi, in Haryana, is another very recent excavation site.
A trip to such a site will transfer you back to those times. You must visit such sites whenever you get an opportunity. Also, find out more about such sites in other countries too.<br/>
<b>Geography</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study of History and Archaeology remains incomplete without knowing something about the Geography of the area being studied. Geography is the study of the earth’s landscapes, people, places and environment. In simple terms, it is knowing about the world in which we live. Geography is unique in bridging the social sciences (human geography) with the natural sciences (physical geography).<br/>
<b>Political Science</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is a word with which you are familiar. You often hear or read about it in the newspapers or on the television. Have you ever thought about what a government is? Do you know the role it plays in our lives and the important things it does for the people. The government of a country makes laws and everyone living in the country has to obey these laws. In democracy, it is the people who give power to the government when they elect them. In this way people help the Parliament of that country to make laws. While in a monarchy, it is the monarch or king/queen who has the powers to take decisions and enforce them. Social Science also deals with how we are governed. It also helps us to understand the role of people like us in the running of nations and governments. This discipline is called Political Science.
<br/>
<b>Sociology</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sociology is yet another very important part of Social Science. It is the study of human behavior in societal context. Sociology focuses on the study of human groups. Sociology comes from the Latin word ‘sociologie’. It literally means the study of companion. Sociology seeks to understand the structure of a society and how it works. It also seeks to define and understand the different factors that have shaped our society. This includes race, class, gender, culture, religion, belief systems and government. Sociology also studies the way individual and group behaviours impact on the running of our society.<br/>
<b>Economics</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in a society also means that we must know how to organize our lives. We must know how to economise our income, time and resources because all of them are limited. You must also learn to organise your time in such a way so that you can manage to do things you want. Similarly, when we make a budget for our home, we make the best use of the resources which are available to us. We can avoid many problems in this way. We call this study Economics. It is much more than making a budget. It is the scientific study of the ways in which humans make choices about production, consumption and wealth. This becomes very important when we are faced with limited means. It is the social science of striking a balance between needs and available resources. Studying this subject will be more interesting if you apply the learning to real life situations.<br>And so on...
